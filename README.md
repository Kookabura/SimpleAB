# SimpleAB

SimpleAB is a tool to employ A/B or multivariate testing on a MODX Revolution powered website. It lets you set up a set of template or chunk variations, which will be randomly picked. By setting up conversions with snippets, AJAX requests and other ways, you can indicate what worked and what didn't, and use that insight to improve your site.
