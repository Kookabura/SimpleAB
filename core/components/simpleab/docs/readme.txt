SimpleAB is a tool to employ A/B (or even multivariate testing!) on a MODX Revolution powered website.

It was originally developed for Reply.com, after which it has been adopted and developed further by Mark Hamstra for modmore.

The current version lets you dynamically switch templates to one of several variations, as defined in the custom manager page. It also lets you test Chunks.
